Facebook - like, comment, activity feed
	FOR THE LIKE button and all social media plugins: the URL for the "like" should be the view_project (individual project showcase) page

Allow uer to manage his or her projects (look back through past projects) and edit projects (cannot edit the date on "expired" projects)

View the people "going" or "in" a project (this also means allowing people to "join" a project)

Add footer

Get directions from user's location to a project location

Allow ratings of a user whose a project host, ratings of a project, ratings of a user as a volunteer

Limit the amount of markers somehow: proximity to the saved location (this can be found by allowing +- lat or lng in any given direction from the lat and lng coordinates of the location position). Only the top 10 most relevant, by filter tags, recent something. 
	There is also a side bar to check out projects in your area.

crowdfunding - crowdtilt (https://github.com/Crowdtilt/crowdtilt-api-spec/) or paypal

3) BUG: facebook login has a 14 second redirect time limit: PAGE WILL CRASH (by displaying a long error message) afterwards
	1) instead of diplaying error message --> Redirect to an ERROR PAGE (also redirect to this error page upon unsuccessful queries)
